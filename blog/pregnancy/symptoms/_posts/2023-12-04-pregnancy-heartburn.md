During pregnancy, numerous symptoms may manifest, and one of these is heartburn. Whether it's a recent development or you've been grappling with it for an extended period, continue reading to gain comprehensive insights into the symptoms, causes, and effective ways to alleviate heartburn during pregnancy.

### Symptoms of Heartburn in Pregnancy
If you've never experienced heartburn, it's easy to misconstrue its association with the heart. Contrary to its name, heartburn results from stomach acid flowing back into the esophagus, often referred to as acid reflux. This prevalent pregnancy symptom triggers a burning sensation in the throat and chest at the heart level.

Heartburn is a widespread occurrence, and many women may encounter it at some point during pregnancy, sometimes for the first time, which can be surprising and concerning.

### Causes of Heartburn During Pregnancy
Heartburn can emerge at any pregnancy stage but typically starts around 27 weeks and beyond. The primary culprits behind pregnancy-related heartburn include:

Hormonal surges during pregnancy impacting the digestive system.  
The expanding uterus exerting pressure on the stomach.  
Relaxation of muscles between the esophagus and stomach, allowing stomach acid to rise.  

### Pregnancy Heartburn Relief and Prevention
To alleviate and prevent heartburn during pregnancy, consider the following 10 tips:

Consume smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day.  
Avoid rich, spicy, and fatty foods known to trigger heartburn.  
Refrain from eating within three hours of bedtime.  
Steer clear of overeating.  
Limit consumption of caffeinated drinks.  
Quit smoking to prevent relaxation of gullet muscles.  
Abstain from alcohol.  
Maintain an upright posture, especially while eating.  
Elevate your head and shoulders with pillows when lying down to prevent acid reflux during sleep.  
Incorporate relaxation techniques into your routine.
