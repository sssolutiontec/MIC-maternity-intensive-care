The initial bath for your baby marks a significant milestone in your parenting journey, creating a moment to cherish. These baths will evolve into cherished bonding experiences. Continue reading to discover the optimal timing and techniques for giving your newborn a bath, as well as the recommended frequency during the initial months.

### Frequency of Newborn Baths
Surprisingly, your newborn doesn't require daily baths. Two or three bath sessions per week are sufficient, supplemented by daily 'topping and tailing'â€”a quick cleanup of the face, neck, hands, and bottom during nappy changes. Decide when to initiate the first official bath based on your preference. You can opt for 'top and tail' cleanses in the early days before transitioning to proper baths.

### Topping and Tailing
Rather than a daily bath, 'topping and tailing' involves a quick clean of the face, neck, hands, and bottom. This approach is suitable, especially in the initial days, providing an alternative to a full bath until you gain confidence in handling your newborn.

### Topping and Tailing Procedure
To 'top and tail,' lay your baby on your lap or a changing mat, in a vest and nappy, and wrap in a towel. Use damp cotton wool for cleaning, starting with the eyes, ears, face, neck, and hands. Ensure a fresh piece of cotton wool for each part, including the nappy area. Finish by drying and dressing your baby.

### Bathing Your Newborn in a Bath
Giving your baby a proper bath every few days is recommended. Prepare the space with a warm room, a baby bath or a clean washing-up bowl, two towels, cotton wool, a small sponge (optional), a fresh nappy, and clean clothes. Use plain water during the first month, transitioning to emollient cream later for added skin protection.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Bathing
Fill the baby bath, check the temperature, and clean the face with wet cotton wool. Support your baby over the bath and wash the hair (if any). Dry the hair, remove the nappy, and gently place your baby in the bath, ensuring the head and umbilical cord stump remain above water. Swish water over the body, lift your baby, and pat dry.

### Best Time for Bathing
Select a time when interruptions are least likely and when your baby is awake and content. Avoid bathing a tired or hungry baby. As your infant grows, consider incorporating bath time into the evening routine.

### Additional Tips for Baby Bath Time
Offer a post-bath massage for relaxation.  
Consider having a bath with your baby for a comforting experience.  
Engage in conversation or sing to reassure and relax your baby.  
Use bath time to address skin conditions like cradle cap, applying prescribed moisturizing cream if needed.

### FAQs 
When should newborns have their first bath?  
It's at your discretion; waiting a few days is common. Until then, 'topping and tailing' is sufficient.

Should you bathe baby before or after a feed?  
Avoid bathing immediately after a feed; any awake and content time is suitable.

How often should you bathe a 2-week-old baby?  
Two or three times a week is ample; 'topping and tailing' between baths is recommended.

How warm should a baby bath be?  
Aim for around 37 degrees Celsius, ensuring warmth without excess heat. Test with your wrist or elbow before bathing.
